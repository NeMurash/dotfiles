Man I just be thinking
To YOU it's a UFO. I know what it is
The fish are whispering to me
Cheesed to be me
So... How's work?
Well, here I am

Live laugh love
Pain is inevitable, suffering is a choice
Don't worry about me, I'll just keep going
It's going to be okay, but it's going to be different
Beautiful things come and go, but they come
You didn't come this far to only come this far
Another day another dollar
As long as you have yourself, you are not alone
Joy has the habit of returning
No love is wasted, no kindness unnoticed
Growth comes with a lot of goodbyes
It got better before, it will get better again
What if I still love you?
